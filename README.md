## Description

Some description

I'm using the **Maven** build system, **Java version 22** and **Spring Boot version 3.2.4**. To work on the application faster and more efficiently, I use the following dependencies:
 - **Lombok** to write less boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors, etc.).
 - **Spring Boot DevTools** to be able to reload the application while the application is running in the IDE.
 - **Spring Boot Starter Validation** to validate data.
 - **Spring Web** because it is a web application.
 - **Thymeleaf** as a template engine.
